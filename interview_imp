Hi 
My name is Sumit
Currently I am working with Velosis Sys Pvt Ltd:
Here my roles and responsibilities are:
We have java based applications
We deploy those applications in multiple envs using Jenkins cicd- 

we use stages such as:
1. stage("checkout scm")we Checkout from scm , we are using github as an SCM tool.
2. stage ("build")build the code using build tool that is - maven
3. stage("Static Code Analysis") - we are using sonar for that
3. Push the artifacts into nexus repo
4. Take the backup of application (war, tomcats)
5. Stop the processes (tomcat)
6. Deploy the artifacts in application server that is apache tomcat
7. Start the processes 
8. Post release check - testing. We are using selenium for testing

We have java based microservices, we dockerize those applications by creating custom docker images.
we create image from Dockerfile using docker build command(docker build -t nameofdockerimage:$version .)

Deploy it into different different enviornments. we have QA, Staging, PROD and UAT enviornments.

We push those images to our docker registry. we are using AWS-ECR(Elastic Container Registry) as a docker registry. 

We pull those emages in different envs and execute using docker run command.

aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-southeast-1 --profile  $profile | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $account_id.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
docker tag $app_name:$version $account_id.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/$cluster_name:$version
docker push $account_id.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/$cluster_name:$version
===================================================================
Docker is a containerization tool. we can comapre it with VM. but containers are light weight. resourse utilization is good.
=========================================================-
GIT - 

master branch is the top most branch - we do prod release
we have development branch - we do release in Pre prod envs from here.
we have feature branches - which are created by developers as per their ERP numbers.(ticketing tool)
Feature branch is being mergeed to development branch 
finally development branch will be merged to master.
===============================================================================================
Nexus:
artifacts mgmnt tool. we keep our artifacts in nexus.
which version - 3
repositories:
Staging.
Release repo.
=========================================================- 
dockerfile for microservices:
Dockerfile: 
#FROM instruction - It uses base image 
FROM openjdk:11.0.2-jre-slim
MAINTAINER snehasish
#COPY erp-%VERSION%.jar .
#COPY instruction is to copy the files or directories from source to destination
COPY target/erp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar .
# RUN instruction runs the commads written
RUN mkdir -p /home/localfiles
#CMD /usr/bin/java -Xmx400m -Xms400m -jar erp-%VERSION%.jar
# CMD instruction, runs when container is being created
CMD /usr/bin/java -Xmx400m -Xms400m -jar erp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
# which port will be used , for example in server.xml connector port is 8085
EXPOSE 8085
----------------------------------
dockerfile for java application(modules)
